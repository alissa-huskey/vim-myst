vim-myst
========

Vim syntax highlighting for [MyST][] markdown files.

At the moment it really just identifies MyST files and highlights the comments appropriately.

Development Status
------------------

<h2 align="center">:warning: Pre-alpha, In-Development/Abandoned</h2>

I stopped working on this abruptly and left the code in a messy, half-baked
state. I might start to work on it again at some point. Who can say?

It's functional (for me) but use at your own risk.
